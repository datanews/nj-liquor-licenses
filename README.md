# NJ Liquor Licenses (as of March 2016)

A list of New Jersey liquor licenses provided by the NJ Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control in March 2016.

For license type definitions and other key information, consult the ABC [website](http://www.nj.gov/lps/abc/index.html) or [handbook](http://www.nj.gov/oag/abc/downloads/abchandbook02.pdf).

A few notes:
* A small percentage of the licenses are listed as "Active" but have listed expiration dates more than two years old; their status is unclear.
* Mailing addresses have been removed, but premises addresses are listed.
